# Fall-2015-Classwork
This is a complete collection of the code I wrote for various computer science courses in the Fall of 2015 (my Freshman year of college.) Presented here to give potential employers an example of my coding ability. All code in this repository is copyright Isaac "I" Coleman 2015-2017.
